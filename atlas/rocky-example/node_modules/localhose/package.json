  "readme": "Localhose\n=========\n\nLocalhose is a [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) module that provides a simple API for dynamically adding hosts to the `/etc/hosts` file, to fool your web browser into thinking `anydomain.com` points to your local machine. This makes web development easier, since the local build and production build can now use identical URLs.\n\n**WARNING: This software requires superuser access, and will temporarily overwrite your hosts file. If you do not understand what that means, it's probably not a good tool for you.**\n\n## Requirements\n\n* [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), tested with 0.4.1\n* OS X, version 10.5 or later (soon, any OS with a `hosts` file)\n* superuser access to your machine\n\n## Install\n\n    $ npm install localhose\n    \n## Module API\n\n### localhose = require( \"localhose\" )\n\nReturns a global `localhose` object that keeps track of what domains are being rerouted.\n\n### localhose.set( host1, [host2], [etc] )\n\nAdds one or more hosts to be routed to your local machine. The hosts are stored within the existing hosts file, like this:\n\n    # <localhose>\n    # The following have been added temporarily by Localhose\n    # For more information, see https://github.com/jed/localhose\n    127.0.0.1\tyourdomain.com\n    127.0.0.1\tyourdomain.net\n    # </localhose>\n\nThe path of the host file can be specified using the `hostsPath` property of the `localhose.constructor.prototype` object.\n\n### localhose.unset( [host1], [host2], [etc] )\n\nRemoves some or all of the hosts rerouted to your machine. If no arguments are specified, all currently hosts are unset. If no hosts remain after this is called, the `# <localhose> ... # </localhose>` section of the current `hosts` file is removed, leaving your file system as pristine as it was before.\n\n### localhose.domains()\n\nReturns a list of domains currently being rerouted to `127.0.0.1`\n\n## Command-line API\n\n### $ sudo localhose set host1 [host2] [etc]\n\nSame as `localhose.set`, but for the command line.\n\n### $ sudo localhose unset [host1] [host2] [etc]\n\nSame as `localhose.unset`, but for the command line.\n\n## Example\n\nFor an example rerouting `nodejs.org` to your machine, see [test.js](/jed/localhose/blob/master/test.js). Otherwise, usage is basically like this:\n\n    // sudo node ./someFile.js\n    localhose = require( \"localhose\" )\n    \n    // resolve \"google.com\" and \"google.org\" to 127.0.0.1.\n    // note that you will be unable to use google while this is set.\n    localhose.set( \"google.com\", \"google.org\" )\n    \n    localhose.domains() // [ \"google.com\", \"google.org\" ]\n    \n    // remove all domains, and revert the `hosts` file to its original state\n    localhose.unset( \"google.com\" )\n\n## TODO\n\n* Add support for non-OS X systems if anyone's interested.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nCopyright (c) 2011 Jed Schmidt.
